# recon

This is a script set athat allows me to conduct recon and automatic scans on a bug bounty programme from google cloud shell.
Google cloud shell is a 16GB RAM cloud VM that is free of cost for lifetime. But it purges the files and data every month. It also stops the running processes after 3 days without login.
I intend to use this set of supporting scripts to help me leverage this lifetime free VPS to peform automated activites rqeuired for bug bounty.

Most of the tools I selected in my workflow are based on go-language for easier installation and faster execution.
