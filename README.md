# recon

This is a script set that allows me to conduct recon and automatic scans on a bug bounty programme from google cloud shell.
Google cloud shell is a 16GB RAM cloud VM that is free of cost for lifetime. But it purges the files and data every month. It also stops the running processes after 3 days without login.
I intend to use this set of supporting scripts to help me leverage this lifetime free VPS to quickly install the required tools and peform automated activites required for bug bounty hunting.

Most of the tools I selected in my workflow are based on go-language for easier installation and faster execution.

***I will upload my workflow diagram soon
